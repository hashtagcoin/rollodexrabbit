## Path Resolution Fixes

### Issue
The application was using path aliases (e.g., `@/lib/supabase`) which were causing bundling errors in both development and testing environments. This resulted in errors like:

```
Unable to resolve "@/lib/supabase" from "app\(tabs)\community\groups\[id].tsx"
Unable to resolve "@/providers/AuthProvider" from "app\_layout.tsx"
Unable to resolve "../../../assets/images/default-avatar.png" from "app\(tabs)\community\groups\[id].tsx"
```

### Approach
We systematically identified and replaced all path aliases with direct relative paths throughout the codebase:

1. **Identification**: Used grep search to find all instances of `@/` path aliases
2. **Analysis**: Determined the correct relative path for each import
3. **Implementation**: Updated each file with proper relative paths
4. **Verification**: Tested bundling to ensure no more path resolution errors

### Files Fixed
- `app/_layout.tsx`: Updated paths for hooks and providers
- Auth screens: `sign-in.tsx`, `sign-up.tsx`, `onboarding.tsx`
- Community screens: Group views and creation screens
- Profile screens: Settings and edit screens
- Component files: `AppHeader.tsx`, `NotificationBell.tsx`
- Test files: Updated mock imports

### Key Learnings
- Path aliases require proper configuration in both development and testing environments
- Direct relative paths are more reliable but require careful counting of directory levels
- Asset paths need special attention, especially in deeply nested components
- Test files often need different import paths than their corresponding components

## TypeScript Error Handling

### Issue
The codebase contained numerous TypeScript errors related to untyped error variables in catch blocks. This resulted in errors like:

```
'e' is of type 'unknown'
```

Additionally, there were issues with duplicate property names in style objects and unsafe access to nested data structures.

### Approach
We implemented a systematic approach to TypeScript error handling:

1. **Proper Error Typing**: Updated all catch blocks to use `catch (e: unknown)` instead of `catch (e)`
2. **Safe Error Access**: Implemented type checking before accessing error properties
3. **Consistent Pattern**: Applied a consistent error handling pattern across the codebase
4. **Improved Error Messages**: Added fallback messages for non-Error objects

### Example Pattern
```typescript
try {
  // Operation that might throw
} catch (e: unknown) {
  console.error('Error description:', e);
  setError(e instanceof Error ? e.message : 'Fallback error message');
} finally {
  // Cleanup code
}
```

### Files Fixed
We fixed TypeScript errors in over 15 files, including:
- Auth flows: `onboarding.tsx`
- Community features: `create.tsx`, `post.tsx`
- Provider services: `[id].tsx`, `create.tsx`
- Profile management: `edit.tsx`
- Wallet and rewards: `submit-claim.tsx`, `claim-reward.tsx`

### Additional TypeScript Fixes
- Resolved duplicate property names in style objects
- Improved data access patterns for nested structures
- Added proper type checking for optional properties

## Package Version Management

### Issue
The application had warnings about package version compatibility with the installed Expo version:

```
The following packages should be updated for best compatibility with the installed expo version:
  @react-native-community/datetimepicker@8.3.0 - expected version: 8.2.0
  @react-native-segmented-control/segmented-control@2.5.7 - expected version: 2.5.4
```

### Approach
We addressed this by:
1. Identifying the specific version requirements
2. Updating the `package.json` file to use exact versions without caret (`^`)
3. Choosing to maintain the newer versions while acknowledging potential compatibility issues

## Testing Improvements

### Issue
Jest tests were failing due to path resolution issues and improper mocking.

### Approach
We fixed the testing environment by:
1. Updating import paths in test files to use direct relative paths
2. Ensuring mock implementations matched the updated import structure
3. Running tests to verify all tests pass with the new path resolution approach

### Results
All tests now pass successfully, with only minor React warnings about:
- State updates not wrapped in `act()`
- Duplicate keys in test data

## Best Practices

### Path Resolution
- **Consistency**: Use either all path aliases or all relative paths, not a mix
- **Configuration**: If using path aliases, ensure proper configuration in all environments
- **Verification**: Verify asset paths exist before debugging more complex issues
- **Testing**: Ensure test files use the same import strategy as application code

### TypeScript Error Handling
- **Type Unknown**: Always type catch variables as `unknown`
- **Type Checking**: Use `instanceof Error` before accessing error properties
- **Fallback Messages**: Provide user-friendly fallback error messages
- **Console Logging**: Include console.error for debugging purposes

### Component Structure
- **Consistent Styling**: Avoid duplicate style property names
- **Safe Data Access**: Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing for nested data
- **Error Boundaries**: Implement error boundaries for critical components

### Testing
- **Mock Consistency**: Ensure mocks match the actual implementation
- **Unique Keys**: Use unique keys in test data to avoid React warnings
- **Act Wrapping**: Wrap state updates in `act()` when possible

## Future Recommendations

1. **Path Alias System**: Consider implementing a proper path alias system using `babel-plugin-module-resolver` that works consistently across all environments

2. **Error Handling Utility**: Create a centralized error handling utility to standardize error processing

3. **Automated Linting**: Set up stricter TypeScript linting rules to catch similar issues earlier

4. **Test Coverage**: Increase test coverage, especially for error handling scenarios

5. **Documentation**: Maintain this development documentation with ongoing technical decisions and fixes
