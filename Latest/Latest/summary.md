## Best Practices

Throughout all development, follow these established practices:

### TypeScript Error Handling
Always use the following pattern for error handling:
```typescript
try {
  // Database operations
} catch (e: unknown) {
  // Properly type the error as unknown and check type before accessing
  setError(e instanceof Error ? e.message : 'An unknown error occurred');
}
```

### Database Error Handling
Implement fallback data when database operations fail:
```typescript
try {
  const { data, error } = await supabase.from('table').select('*');
  if (error) throw error;
  setData(data || []);
} catch (e: unknown) {
  console.error('Error:', e instanceof Error ? e.message : 'Unknown error');
  setData(fallbackData); // Use mock data for a better user experience
}
```

### Component Structure
Follow the established component pattern:
```typescript
interface ComponentProps {
  // Props definition
}

export default function Component({ prop1, prop2 }: ComponentProps) {
  // State and hooks

  // Effect hooks

  // Helper functions

  // Render
  return (
    // JSX
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  // Styles
});
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Integration with External NDIS Systems**
   - Plan for connecting to NDIS payment gateways
   - Prepare for integration with official NDIS APIs

2. **Advanced AI Features**
   - Service recommendations based on user preferences
   - Accessibility assistance through AI
   - Automated content moderation

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Database query optimization
   - React Native component rendering optimization
   - Image and asset loading improvements
